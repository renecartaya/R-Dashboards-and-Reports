## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

\clearpage

## Embedded automated plots

You can embed automated plots within reports:

```{r scatterplot, echo=FALSE}

a <- c(0:9)
b <- a^2
plot(a,b, type = "l",
          col="blue", 
          xlab = "x axis", 
          ylab = "y axis", 
          main = "Graphic title")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
